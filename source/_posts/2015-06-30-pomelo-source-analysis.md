As a matter of fact, we can gain lots of benefits from reading source code, so I start to read a game framwork. 
[Pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo) is a fast, scalable game server framework for node.js. I choose it for several reasons.

1. open source code, hosted in Github.
2. contains all the features of game server, and fully documented.
3. help me to get know node.js.
4. similar to my project in work.

<h3>Main features</h3>

- <a herf="">framework</a>
- <a herf="">connection: rpc, protocal</a>
