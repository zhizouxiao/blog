First, take a look at the inside change.

1. **You will be a good writer.** At its core, writing is communcation. it is about recoreding thoughts on paper. it will impore with practise. Blogging will not force 
you to become a better writer, it will happen as you do it. And becoming a better writer holds important benefits for the rest of your life--whether you are creating a book, a presentation, a resume, or an anniversary card for your spouse.
    
2. **You will develop an eye for meaningful things.** it is simply not possible to write about every thing in your life.

3. **You will be a better thinker.** the blogging process enourages you to think deeper. Once you start writing about your life and the thoughts that shape it, you'll begin thinking more intentionally about who you are and who you are becoming.

4. **It will lead to healthier life habits.** Blogging requires time, devotion, commitment, and discipline. those are good things to embrace.


Then, the outside change.

1. **Connect people like you.** Blogging brings like-minded people together. Starting a blog can help you find those people and share your opinions and thoughts or books and songs.
