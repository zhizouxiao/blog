### Just for fun

> nobody can predict future, not even linus.

1. Number One is: “Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.” If you follow that rule, you’ll always know how to behave in any situation. Number Two is: “Be proud of what you do.” Number Three: “And have fun doing it.

2. what I find to be unacceptable is when people, either leaders or followers, then try to impose their own world views on others.

3. I’m a big believer in individual choice, which means that I think I should make my own decisions when it comes to moral issues.

4. “Ain’t no time to hate.”

5. What really sells, of course, is perception, not reality. Cruise liners sell the perception of freedom, of the salty seas, of good food and romance of Love Boat proportions.

6. In fact, nobody even wants a computer. What everybody wants is this magical toy that can be used to browse the Web, write term papers, play games, balance the checkbook, and so on.

7. And I, as a technologist, know that technology drives nothing. It is society that changes technology, not the other way around. Technology just sets the boundaries for what we can do, and how cheaply we can do it.

9. “that’s it: Survival. Your place in the social order. And entertainment.”
