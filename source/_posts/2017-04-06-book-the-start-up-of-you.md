### the start-up of you

> 随着社会变化的加快，工作变为短期合同，为了适应变化，
> 书中推荐普通人也要像企业家一样来对待自己的职业生涯。
> 对我以后的职业有指导意义。

1. Make a list of your key uncertainties, doubts, and questions you have about your career at the present moment. Make a list of the hypotheses you’re develop. Write out your current Plan A and Plan Z, and jot some notes about what possible Plan B moves might be in your current situation. 
    
2. Make a plan to develop more transferable skills, those skills and experiences that are broadly useful to potential other jobs. Writing skills, general management experience, technical and computer skills, people smarts, and international experience or language skills are examples of skills with high option value—that is, they are transferable to a wide range of possible Plan B’s. 

3. Begin on an experimental side project that you work on during some nights and weekends. Orient it around a skill or experience that is different but related—something that either enhances what you do now or can serve as a possible Plan B if your Plan A doesn’t work out. Ideally, collaborate on this project with someone else in your network.

4. Establish an identity independent of your employer, city, industry. Reserve a personal domain name (yourname.com). Print up a second set of business cards with just your name on it and a personal email address.

5. Reach out to five people who work in adjacent niches and ask them to coffee. Compare your plans with theirs. Keep up these relationships over time so you can access diverse information and so you’re in a better position to potentially pivot to those niches when necessary.
 
6. World-class professionals build networks to help them navigate the world. No matter how brilliant your mind or strategy, if you’re playing a solo game, you’ll always lose out to a team.
 
7. In alliances, resources and assistance flow both ways.
 
8. The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be.
 
9. While most people have a small circle of close friends, they maintain a large circle of these valued acquaintances and colleagues. Relationship builders prioritize high-quality relationships over a large number of connections.

10. The first is professional allies. Who would be in your corner in a conflict or when you come under stress? Whom do you invite to dinner to brainstorm career options? Whom do you trust and proactively try to work with if you can? From whom do you solicit feedback on key projects? Whom do you review life goals and plans with? These are your allies. Many people can maintain at most eight to ten strong professional alliances at any given point in time.
 
12. The Strength of Weak Ties: The friends you don’t know very well are the ones who refer winning jobs. Weak ties can uniquely serve as bridges to other worlds and thus can pass on information or opportunities you have not heard about.
 
13. Here we want to explore how opportunities flow through congregations of these people. Those with good ideas and information tend to hang out with one another. You will get ahead if you can tap the circles that dish the best opportunities. It’s how people have gotten ahead for centuries.

14. 1)Overall, it’s probably not as risky as you think.
 
    2)Is the worst-case scenario tolerable or intolerable?
 
    3)Can you change or reverse the decision midway through? Is Plan B doable?
 
15. Remember: If you don’t find risk, risk will find you.
 
16. Who You Know Is What You Know.
 
17.  Remember Iwe: an individual’s power is raised exponentially with the help of a network.
